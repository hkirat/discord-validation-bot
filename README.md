## Discord Validation Bot

### The problem
Folks who had not bought the course ended up joining the Discord channel by sharing links amongst themselves.

### Constraints
We need a way to verify users' email addresses within Discord, while adhering to the following constraints: 
 - We can't send a user a DM (as it would trigger the Discord's blocking mechanism).
 - We can't request the users send us a DM.
 - On a public channel, we can't make the users reveal their email addresses while undergoing verification.

### Solution
To understand the solution, please watch a small clip video on YouTube.
The live session was exclusively held for those who have bought the course.
